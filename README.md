This is a simple batch script to find and download movie torrents from [YTS](https://yts.mx)
This script is 100% dependent on YIFY / YTS. It is only possible because of their website. 
This script is just a simple, ad-free interface for their site and all credit for the content belongs to them.

# BEFORE PROCEEDING
1) You must have a torrent app installed in your system. Some examples include [QBitTorrent](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent-win32/), [BitTorrent](https://bittorrent.en.softonic.com/), [uTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com/downloads/win/) and so on.
2) If you haven't selected a default app for opening torrent files, you need to right click any torrent file and select "Open With". Then, a popup will appear. Just click on "More Apps" button available in the center-left side of your popup window. Then, select any torrent app that you've downloaded in your system. Tick the checkbutton that says, "Always Use This App To Open .torrent Files" and finally, click on the "OK" button.
3) After performing the step 2, you are ready to use the script

# REQUIREMENTS
Other than a torrent application, you do not need to install anything. Just download this script, which already utilizes the Windows Command Prompt & Powershell commands, and double click to run it. For those people whose torrent files already open in torrent applications, you do not need to perform the second step described above. If you have any concerns regarding the script, you can simply notify me in the issues section. I would like to remind you again that this script is possible because of YTS/YTS. Thank You.
